    <p>
      Wayne Mark Rooney (born 24 October 1985) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the head
      coach of EFL Championship club Plymouth Argyle. Widely considered one of the best players of his generation and one of
      the greatest English players of all time,[4] Rooney is the record goalscorer for Manchester United, and was the record
      goalscorer for the England national team from 2015 to 2023. He has also made more appearances for England than any other
      outfield player.[5] Rooney spent most of his playing career as a forward, but was also used in various midfield roles.

    <h2>International Career</h2>
    <p>
      Rooney was eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, through his Irish paternal grandparents.[16][270] In 2015, he
      confirmed that he had rejected an approach from Ireland at the age of 16, describing himself as "English through and
      through".[271]
      Rooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly defeat against
      Australia at the Boleyn Ground on 12 February 2003 at 17 years and 111 days, coming on at half-time as manager
      Sven-Göran Eriksson fielded a different team in each half.[272] On 6 September of that year, aged 17 years and 317 days,
      he became the youngest player to score for England, equalising in a 2–1 away victory over Macedonia in a UEFA Euro 2004
      qualifying match.
